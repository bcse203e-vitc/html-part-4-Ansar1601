      <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
  <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves a combination of front-end (what users see) and back-end (server-side) development to create fully functional websites and web applications.</p>

  <p>The front-end includes everything the user interacts with: layout, design, colors, buttons, and content. This is typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js make it easier to build complex front-end interfaces.</p>

  <p>Back-end development refers to server-side programming that powers the logic, database operations, authentication, and APIs. Common languages used are PHP, Python, Node.js, and Java. Frameworks like Django, Express, and Laravel help structure backend code efficiently.</p>

  <p>Responsive design ensures that websites look great on all devicesâ€”desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS media queries, Flexbox, and Grid Layout are widely used to create responsive layouts.</p>

  <p>Version control systems like Git are essential for tracking code changes and collaborating with teams. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab are popular for managing repositories and collaborating with other developers.</p>

  <p>Modern web development also involves using package managers (like npm or yarn), task runners (like Gulp), and build tools (like Webpack or Vite) to automate and streamline development workflows.</p>

  <p>Accessibility and performance are key aspects of quality web development. Optimizing images, minifying code, and ensuring screen-reader compatibility improve user experience and site performance.</p>

  <p>With the rise of cloud computing, many web apps are now hosted on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Netlify. These platforms offer scalability, continuous deployment, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.</p>
